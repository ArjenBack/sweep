# Sweep ðŸ¦€
Keymap and software for my Ferris Sweep ðŸ§¹ running ZMK on two nice!nanos.

See my [keymap](https://github.com/adrian-fuertes/keymaps) repository for detailed diagrams of the key layers.

To download the firmware, download the artifacts produced by the latest [Github action](https://github.com/adrian-fuertes/sweep/actions) run. It contains a `.uf2` firmware file for each half which you can directly flash into the controllers.
